  Screen + voice → structured work. The user records their screen while talking (demoing their product, browsing,
  exploring an idea, reading their own draft or a source); turn the recording into items — bug/polish issues with
  repro steps, frames and suspected code, ideas, notes, todos, and in writing projects revision remarks located in the
  manuscript, reactions to sources, material gaps and spoken thinking kept in the author's own words — let them
  review on a local page, then export (writing discussion record, Feishu/Lark Bitable, CSV/Markdown, GitHub
  Issues…) or start fixing. Use when the user wants to record feedback / QA / ideas / reading notes by talking while
  using their screen, hands over such a video, or wants to process recordings from the Blurt app.

# blurt 🐔 — show it, say it, get structured work back

People think best out loud with their eyes on the screen. They jump between topics, correct themselves, point at
things. Your job: capture that with no friction, then do the tedious part (splitting, writing up, picking and
marking screenshots, finding the code, filing) with care. Optimise for the user's flow: never interrupt a
recording, ask few questions, make review fast.

Scripts live in `scripts/` next to this file; run them with `uv run <skill-dir>/scripts/<name>.py ...` (each
declares its deps; `uv` installs them on first use). Every script has `--help`. Always reply in the user's
language; write items in the language the user spoke.

## 0. Setup (first run, or when something fails)

- `doctor.py` → OS, RAM/GPU, ffmpeg, configured ASR, recommendations, `todo` list.
- Missing ffmpeg/uv: offer the install command; run it only after the user agrees.
- ASR: if none configured, pick from `asr_recommendations` + the language the user speaks, tell the user in one
  line what and why (size, local vs cloud, cost), run its `setup`. Details: `reference/asr.md`. Cloud keys are set
  by the user in their env — never ask them to paste keys in chat.
- `record.py build` — macOS: compiles the native recorder (Xcode Command Line Tools; else a Tk fallback) and
  installs the **Blurt** menu-bar app into ~/Applications. Windows: the Start-menu shortcut appears on first
  recording. Mention it in one line: "Blurt is also in your Applications — ⌥⇧R records from anywhere".
- `record.py test` → look at the returned `frame` yourself. Wallpaper-only/black or `ok: false` ⇒ Screen Recording
  permission missing; `mic_silent: true` ⇒ Microphone permission / wrong mic. On macOS the permission belongs to the
  app hosting you (Terminal, iTerm, VS Code, Claude, Codex…) and that app must be restarted after granting.
  macOS 15+ may show an "allow … to bypass the window picker" prompt — the user clicks Allow themselves.
- Optional project config `.blurt/config.json`: export target, owners/module map, column mapping, custom lenses in
  `.blurt/lenses/`. Suggest adding `.blurt/sessions/` to `.gitignore`.

## 1. Record (or pick up a recording)

**From the chat:** if the thing to look at is a local dev server/app in this repo, check it is running. Start
`record.py start` **in the background** (`--last-region` to reuse the last area), tell the user in a few lines what
happens, and end your turn:
- a dimmed overlay: drag to draw the area (or click a window, F = full screen) → **开始录制** / Enter. Only that area
  is recorded — tabs, bookmarks and other windows stay private;
- 3-2-1 countdown (click to skip), then a small floating bar: timer · mic level · ⏸ pause · ↺ restart/discard ·
  **完成**. ⌥⇧P pause/resume, ⌥⇧S finish (Windows: Alt+Shift). The bar is never in the recording;
- talk naturally, point with the mouse; click **完成** — no need to come back to the chat, you'll be notified.
The task ends with `DONE video=…` (or `CANCELLED`, exit 2 → acknowledge and stop). From the chat you can also
`record.py stop | pause | resume | restart`.

**Existing video** (QuickTime, OBS, Loom, phone, a teammate's Blurt recording…): create
`.blurt/sessions/<timestamp>/`, copy it in as `recording.<ext>` (with `events.jsonl` / `meta.json` if it came from
Blurt), continue with §2.

**Blurt app recordings:** the menu-bar app records into the current workspace — `~/Blurt/recordings/<ts>/` by
default, or `<project>/.blurt/sessions/<ts>/` when a project is bound. `record.py inbox` lists all of them with
`processed` / `reviewed` flags. "Process my recordings" → do §2–§4 for each unprocessed one (fan out to subagents
if available), then one review per session (or merge into one session dir if the user wants a single list).
`meta.json` has `author` — keep it on items when several people's recordings are combined.

## 2. Transcribe

`transcribe.py run <session>/recording.mp4` → `transcript.json` + `transcript.txt` (`[mm:ss.s-mm:ss.s] text`).
For Whisper/API backends pass `--prompt` with a short glossary (product, page/module names, people) from the repo.
Also run `frames.py scan <video>` (visual-activity index for candidates/sheets).

## 3. Understand → items

Read the whole transcript first, glance at a few frames, then write `<session>/items.json`
(schema: `reference/schema.md`). Decide **per item** what it is — the recording decides, not a mode switch:

| kind | when | lens |
|---|---|---|
| `issue` | something in the product to fix or polish | `reference/lenses/issue.md` |
| `idea` | something to build / change / borrow ("这个网站的这里好") | `reference/lenses/idea.md` |
| `note` | an observation / finding / fact worth keeping | `reference/lenses/note.md` |
| `task` | an action item that isn't a product issue | `reference/lenses/task.md` |
| `revision` · `reading` · `gap` · `thought` | writing project: remarks on the draft, reactions to a source, material to find, thinking aloud | `reference/lenses/<kind>.md` |
| custom | a lens in `.blurt/lenses/` or `~/.blurt/lenses/` fits, or the user asked for it | that file |

**Writing project** (`.blurt/config.json` has `writing`, or `docs/argument-state.md` exists): read
`reference/writing.md` first — the author's words stay verbatim and apart from yours, speech stays local, the
manuscript and argument state are never edited, and `writing.py` fills `said`, locates the draft and exports.

Principles — judgement, not rules:
- One item = one thing. People jump around, revisit, correct themselves ("不对，是…"), or say two things in one
  sentence: merge revisits, drop retracted remarks, split compounds. Pure narration is not an item.
- Fix ASR errors from context (repo vocabulary, what's on screen). Keep `quote` close to what was said.
- Don't invent. When unsure, write your best guess, set `confidence: "low"`, add a short `questions` entry.
- Read URLs / product names off the frames into `source`.
- `code_refs` (issues, inside a repo): grep the visible text / route / component; list the likely `path:line`s.
- Give the session a `title`. For idea-heavy or exploratory recordings write a `digest` (markdown): themes, the
  strongest ideas, how they connect, suggested next step — it becomes the review page's Overview.

## 4. Evidence: frames & clips

Pick 1–3 frames per item that show *the point* (the bug itself, the part of the page that inspired the idea):
- `frames.py sheet <video> --from S --to E -o <session>/sheets/<id>.jpg` → ~6 diverse settled candidates with
  timestamps in one image; `--at t1 t2 …` for specific moments ("这里 / this / look"). Speech often trails the action.
- Marking the spot — never estimate coordinates from a thumbnail or contact sheet:
  1. `frames.py grid <video> --at T -o <session>/sheets/<id>-grid.jpg` → labelled 0–1 grid plus the recorded cursor
     and nearby clicks (events.jsonl — exact). Read box edges off the grid (`--crop` zooms, labels stay full-frame).
  2. `frames.py grab <video> --at T -o <session>/frames/<id>-1.jpg --box x,y,w,h`; `--ring cursor|click` when the user
     pointed at / clicked it. Tiny detail → second frame with `--crop`.
  3. **Look at every annotated frame before using it.** Box not on the point → fix and re-grab.
- Animations / flows / timing: `frames.py clip --from --to -o <session>/clips/<id>.mp4` (< 20 MB).
- Many items (> ~12)? Fan out frame work to subagents in batches if your harness has them.

## 5. Review with the user

Always open the review page — the frames are the point. Run `review.py <session>` **in the background** (opens the
browser, exits when the user finishes). In the same message:
- ≤ 5 items: the full numbered list (kind · title · owner/module, plus `questions`); more: a short summary (counts by
  kind, the headline items, open questions);
- two lines on the page: one item at a time — **A** keep · **X** drop · **J/K** next/prev · **Z** undo · **?** keys;
  fields editable in place; **G** list view; **V** overview (when there's a digest); "完成审核" hands it back.
The user may answer in chat or on the page. End your turn. Afterwards reload `items.json` (dropped items have
`status: "deleted"`, answers are in `answer`). If they reply in chat instead, apply it yourself and close the page
(`pkill -f "review.py <session>"`).

**Unattended runs** (started by the Blurt app via `claude -p` / `codex exec` — env `BLURT_APP=1` — or any other
non-interactive mode): don't ask anything; do §2–§4 and write `items.json`, then finish with a 2–3 sentence summary.
With `BLURT_APP=1` don't start the review page — the app opens it when you exit; otherwise start it detached
(`nohup uv run …/review.py <session> >/dev/null 2>&1 &`). Never export to external systems unattended.

## 6. Export / act

Ask once where things go (remember in `.blurt/config.json` → `export`). Typical: issues → the team's bug table;
ideas → an ideas board / doc; notes → Markdown; tasks → the user's todo tool.
- Feishu/Lark Bitable → `feishu.py export <session> "<table url>" [--kind issue|idea|…]` (lark-cli if installed,
  else app credentials; default columns per kind, creates missing ones, uploads frames + clips, resumable).
  No table yet → `feishu.py create "<name>"`. Other columns → `feishu.py fields` then `--map`.
  Details: `reference/export-feishu.md`.
- Markdown + CSV → `export_local.py <session>` (all kinds; always a good local record).
- Writing project → `writing.py export <session>` (discussion record in writing-companion's format; see
  `reference/writing.md` for where it may go).
- GitHub Issues / Linear / Jira / Notion / Obsidian / anything else → `reference/export-other.md`; use the CLI or
  MCP tool the user has; map fields by meaning.
Confirm destination and count before creating anything remotely; report links afterwards. Then offer the natural
next step — for issues "want me to start fixing these?" (you have `code_refs`), for ideas "want a quick prototype /
spec of the top one?".
